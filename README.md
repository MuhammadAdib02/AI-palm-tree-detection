# AI-palm-tree-detection
A drone-image analysis tool that uses YOLOv8 to automatically detect and count palm trees from aerial photos, enabling quick mapping and monitoring of plantations.

Brief description of the project.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project applies **YOLOv8 object detection** to locate and count palm trees from drone-captured images across various regions in Malaysia.  
The goal is to assist plantation management in mapping tree density and monitoring growth.

> **Note:** This was an internship project and remains an early prototype.  
> The trained model is functional but not yet production-ready.
